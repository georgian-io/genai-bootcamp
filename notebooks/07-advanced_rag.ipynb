He also added 4 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 steals to his stat line. Although it wasn't one of his most impressive performances, Jordan's 15 points in his final NBA game marked a fitting conclusion to an illustrious career that saw him win six NBA championships, five MVP awards, and cement his status as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.\n",

      "Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game , respectively . By 1998 , the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz , he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer . In the regular season , Jordan was the Bulls ' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs , Jordan would always demand the ball at crunch time . Jordan 's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the highest in NBA history . He retired with 32,292 points in regular season play , placing him fourth on the NBA 's all-time scoring list behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Karl Malone , and Kobe Bryant . \n",
      " With five regular-season MVPs ( tied for second place with Bill Russell ; only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has won more , six ) , six Finals MVPs ( NBA record ) , and three All-Star MVPs , Jordan is the most decorated player ever to play in the NBA . Jordan finished among the top three in regular-season MVP voting a record 10 times , and was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 . He is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship , an NBA championship , and an Olympic gold medal ( doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men 's basketball teams ) . \n",
      " Many of Jordan 's contemporaries say that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time . In 1999 , an ESPN survey of journalists , athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century , above such luminaries as Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali . Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press 's December 1999 list of 20th century athletes . In addition , the Associated Press voted him as the basketball player of the 20th century . Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times . In the September 1996 issue of Sport , which was the publication 's 50th anniversary issue , Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years . \n",
      " Jordan 's athletic leaping ability , highlighted in his back-to-back slam dunk contest championships in 1987 and 1988 , is credited by many with having influenced a generation of young players .\n"
