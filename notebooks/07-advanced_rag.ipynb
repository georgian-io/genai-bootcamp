      "Michael Jordan's final NBA game took place on April 18, 2003, when his Washington Wizards faced off against the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. In a game that would ultimately be a 107-87 loss for the Wizards, Jordan, then 40 years old, played 37 minutes and scored 15 points on 6-of-15 shooting from the field, including 1-of-3 from three-point range. He also added 4 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 steals to his stat line. Although the game marked the end of Jordan's illustrious 15-year NBA career, his 15-point performance was a testament to his enduring skill and competitive drive, even in the twilight of his playing days.\n",
