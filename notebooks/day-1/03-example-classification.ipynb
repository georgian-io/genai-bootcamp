This helps the model to \"understand\" the kind of answer that we want from it.\n",

We simply ask it for an answer directly. In-between zero-shot and few-shot prompting lies *one-shot prompting* where we give the model a single example. We illustrate this further towards the end of the notebook where we cover a concept known as Chain of Thought (CoT)."
