    "The models we use in this notebook for OpenAI (Completion API) and PaLM (Text Generation API) are text completion APIs. There is a subtle difference between these APIs and the chat APIs we cover later. The chat APIs are used for conversations. That is, both the user and the model take turns to send messages (like ChatGPT). The text completion APIs on the other hand are meant to be singular prompts where we give the model an instruction and get an output."
