      "User: How do I make a chatbot with OpenAI API?\n",
      "Assistant: To create a chatbot using OpenAI API, you will need to follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Access the API Key: First, you'll need an API key to use OpenAI's GPT-3. You can obtain one by signing up on their website (https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and checking if you can access the API. Keep in mind that there may be a waitlist.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Install OpenAI Python library: Install the required library for Python by running `pip install openai`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Import the library: In your Python code, use `import openai` to import the library.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Set up your API key: Use the `openai.api_key` attribute to set your API key:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import openai\n",
      "openai.api_key = \"your-api-key\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Choose an API \"engine\": The OpenAI API provides a few engines (e.g., \"davinci-codex\", \"text-davinci-002\") that vary in response time, cost, and features. Choose an engine according to your requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Send a prompt to the engine: Create a function that sends a prompt to the engine and receives a response.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def ask_gpt_3(prompt, engine=\"text-davinci-002\"):\n",
      "    response = openai.Completion.create(\n",
      "        engine=engine,\n",
      "        prompt=prompt,\n",
      "        max_tokens=150,\n",
      "        n=1,\n",
      "        stop=None,\n",
      "        temperature=0.5\n",
      "    )\n",
      "    return response.choices[0].text.strip()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we're using the `text-davinci-002` engine and setting some parameters like token length, number of responses, and temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Implement the chatbot: You can now use the `ask_gpt_3` function to interact with the GPT-3 model.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def chatbot():\n",
      "    while True:\n",
      "        prompt = input(\"You: \")\n",
      "        if prompt.lower() in [\"quit\", \"exit\", \"bye\"]:\n",
      "            print(\"Chatbot: Goodbye!\")\n",
      "            break\n",
      "        response = ask_gpt_3(prompt)\n",
      "        print(f\"Chatbot: {response}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Test the chatbot: Run the chatbot function and interact with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "chatbot()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "That's it! You have now created a simple text-based chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 as the underlying engine. Note that there are more options and parameters for customizing the chatbot's behavior, so be sure to check the API documentation for further details.\n"
