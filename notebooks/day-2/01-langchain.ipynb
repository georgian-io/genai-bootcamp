      "4. Use list comprehension: Instead of using a for loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence, you can use list comprehension to make the code more concise. This can be done by initializing `fib_numbers` with the first two elements and then using a list comprehension to generate the remaining elements.\n",

      "5. Use memoization for better performance: If you anticipate that the function will be called multiple times with the same `n` value, you can use memoization to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers. This can significantly improve the performance of the function.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Consider using a generator: If the Fibonacci sequence is expected to be very large, it might be more memory-efficient to use a generator instead of returning a list. This way, the Fibonacci numbers can be generated on-the-fly as needed.\n",
