Yo, I stepped in the store, you know what for,
Had a craving for Doritos, couldn't ignore,
Grabbed a bag, the flavor so bold,
Munchin' on chips, yeah, I'm feelin' like gold,

Doritos and gum, that's how I roll,
Snackin' and chewin', I'm in control,
Jay-Z in the house, you know it's no lie,
When it comes to snackin', I'm that guy,

Verse 2:
Next up, gotta get that chewing gum,
Fresh breath, yeah, I'm ready to stun,
Minty or fruity, I got that choice,
But either way, I'mma make 'em rejoice,

I got my snacks, now I'm ready to go,
Headin' back home, got that Hov flow,

Jay-Z in the building, I'm puttin' on a show,

Doritos and gum, that's how I roll,
Snackin' and chewin', I'm in control,

So that's the story, now you know the deal,
When I'm out snackin', I keep it real,
Doritos and gum, it's the way to be,
