"I went to the store, bought doritos and chewing gum","(Verse 1)
Yo, I stepped in the store, feelin' hungry as hell,
Cravin' some snacks, man, I just couldn't quell,
Walked down the aisle, with a mission in mind,
To find the perfect combo, the tastiest kind.

(Chorus)
Doritos and gum, that's what I'm after,
Crunchy and chewy, bringin' joy and laughter,
Doritos and gum, ain't nothin' better,
Satisfyin' my cravings, like a lyrical go-getter.

(Verse 2)
I grabbed them Doritos, the nacho cheese flavor,
The scent hit my nose, somethin' I had to savor,
Then I found that gum, the minty fresh kind,
A chewy sensation, to blow my mind.

(Bridge)
Chorus mixin' flavors, like my rhymes mixin' beats,
Goin' together perfectly, like my life and these streets,
Doritos and gum, the ultimate pair,
A snack-time delight, ain't nothin' can compare.

(Chorus)
Doritos and gum, that's what I'm after,
Crunchy and chewy, bringin' joy and laughter,
Doritos and gum, ain't nothin' better,
Satisfyin' my cravings, like a lyrical go-getter.

(Outro)
So next time you're hungry, and you don't know what to do,
Just remember this rap, and let it guide you through,
Doritos and gum, they'll never let you down,
A snack-time duo, that's always wearin' the crown."
